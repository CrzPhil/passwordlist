# PasswordList Generator
## A Customised Passwordlist generator for brute force attacks. 

Takes in first and last name, any important date (i.e birthdate) as input, followed by any number of keywords.

Runs some magic and concatinates them with eachother, as well as with the most common passwords of the .txt file. 

After some formatting and several for-loops later, you get a customised wordlist which you can now use ethically and responsibly.
